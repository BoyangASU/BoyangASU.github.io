    abstract = {Defects shape, volume, and orientation all have a direct impact on the mechanical properties of Laser Powder Bed Fused (L-PBF-ed) parts. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate and analyze the three-dimensional (3D) geometrical characteristics of these defects. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) can reveal an object's internal structure by volumetric scanning through its building direction. Point clouds are 3D data that can be extracted from the stack of XCT images taken from a part to perform further analysis. This study presents a novel approach for 3D segmentation and geometrical analysis of L-PBF defect structures from XCT images. The proposed method integrates Voronoi labeling and 3D point cloud reconstruction to reveal individual defect characteristics from the XCT image stack of a part. A case study showed the proposed methodology's effectiveness in identifying and characterizing defect regions in L-PBF-ed Cobalt-Chrome (CoCr) parts.},

    abstract = {Internal defects, e.g., lack of fusion and porosity, are major quality concerns in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). In post-process part inspection, X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) is used to scan the part to reveal the defective regions inside. 2-dimensional XCT images are obtained showing the part’s cross-section at different heights (layers). Segmenting the defects from raw XCT images is necessary to locate the defected regions, evaluate the part’s quality, and enable root cause analysis. This study proposes two methods for defect segmentation, one is based on deep learning (DL) and the other based on classic machine learning (ML), and compares them with statistical image thresholding approaches (i.e., K-means, Bernsen’s, Otsu’s Thresholding). A discussion about the method-level difference among these methods is provided, revealing the merits of the proposed DL and ML methods in fast defect segmentation and transfer learning across printing conditions. A Case study is done by applying the DL, ML, and statistical image thresholding methods on real XCT images of L-PBF specimens. The defect segmentation accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DL and ML methods are evaluated. A guideline is developed for automatic defect segmentation from XCT images of L-PBF-ed parts by combining statistical image thresholding and DL/ML methods.},

    abstract = {In 3D printing, support-structure decisions for CAD models heavily rely on expert knowledge. Automatically evaluating CAD geometry and deciding the need for support structures remains challenging. This study adopts the Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF feature detector and descriptor to match geometric features among CAD models and predict support-structure decisions for printing a new CAD model. This work demonstrates the potential of automating 3D printing process planning with AI tools.},
