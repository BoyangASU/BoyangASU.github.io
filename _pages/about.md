I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in Data Science, affiliated with the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI) at Arizona State University advised by Prof. Hao Yan. 

My research interest lies at the intersection of Bayesian Optimization, reinforcement learning, and generative modeling. I develop control policies to advance applications such as fault detection and rare-event prediction.

I welcome collaboration and internship opportunities. If you're interested in my work, please feel free to reach out via email.
